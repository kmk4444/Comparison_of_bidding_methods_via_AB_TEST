Comparison_of_bidding_methods_via_AB_TEST


Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'. One of our customers, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts better than maximum bidding.

The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.

Variables:
Impression: the number of adv views
Click: the number of click-on adv
Purchase: the number of product which is bought by customers after click-on adv
Earning: benefit after product which is purchase by customers
